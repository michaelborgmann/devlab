## How It Works

This demo is built using Vue CLI and consists of a simple component structure. The project includes a root `App.vue` component, and additional components can be added as needed.

## Setup & Run

1. **Install Vue CLI (if you haven't already)**
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
2. **Create a new Vue project**
```
vue create vue-basic
cd vue-basic
```
3. **Start the development server**
```
npm run serve
```

The app will be available at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
